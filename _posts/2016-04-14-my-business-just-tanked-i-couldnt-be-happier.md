So as of two weeks ago, my business threw in the towel on trying to continue. As a new project, I'm going to walk through the timeline of what started me down the path of giving up a fun job as a bartender in Sydney Australia to becoming a start-up farmer to sharing shelf space in Whole Foods with the likes of Tessamae's, Good Culture, and Epic Meats. And ultimately why saying "no" might have been the best decision I made.

Right now, I'm hoping to find this exact spot and try to look nearly as cool as this guy while falling off my rented surfboard.
