Howdy Friends. Welcome to the page about me.
![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/6bb40fb9-3c4c-4ac0-93ee-b89426542cc6.jpg)

Me with my lady. There is a reason she is called my better half.

This is my personal blog. It deals with the bumps, failures, successes, and rewards with building a business. I'll cover everything from how I organize my agenda, make my protein shakes, enjoy free time, how to make critical decisions deciding your future, and what's caught my interest for the time being.

I started Eridani Crops, a business that brought the freshest, high quality produce to consumers by setting up urban growing operations in refurbished shipping containers. Before jumping into my own business, I was a bartender, foreign english teacher, life guard, camp councilor, volunteer EMT, and hay ride driver.

I'm just getting started in this life, but I've learned a lot already. Hopefully you enjoy my musings.

Shoot an email to me anytime if you want to chat, have a questions, or need a good shoulder to cry on at talk.to.ryan.day \[at\] gmail.com

If you need a topic, here are some things I like:

* Ultimate Frisbee
* Good beer, whiskey, or (...and) martinis
* Lifting, protein shakes, and when to eat food
* Thailand, and traveling anywhere.
* Trying something new
* Farmers

With all the hearts,

Your bud Ryan Day
